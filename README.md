This repository contains all the code used for the development of the system proposed in the dissertation "Mobile Image Segmentation App for Mantoux Skin Test" by Raghav Anand as part of the Master's dissertation undertaken at the University of Nottingham under the supervision of Tan Chye Cheah. The project focuses on developing an automated system for interpreting Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) results using zero-shot learning techniques, combining YOLO for detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmentation. The system aims to address the challenges of manual TST result interpretation and is designed to improve tuberculosis screening accessibility, especially in resource-limited environments
